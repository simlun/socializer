Background Story
----------------

ACME Corporation is planning a four day company conference. Employees from all offices will be there. Some will arrive on friday, the rest on saturday, some will leave on sunday, the rest on monday. The HR department wants to make sure the employees from different departments and offices take the chance to get to know each other well. One way to do this is to create efficient table placements for all dinners. The key here is to create a nice mix of people at each table, each dinner. A key point is to make sure the same people do not sit together several dinners in a row. This is more than simple table placements done by hand. ACME Corp. needs a tool for socializing efficiently!


Research
--------

There are several tools for creating a table seating plan, but few (none?) account for the social aspects of several events in sequence with the same guests.
