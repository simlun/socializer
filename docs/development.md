Development
===========

Project start is inspired by the "Walking Skeleton" of [GOOS][goos].

* Automatically testable, buildable, deployable.
* "A Walking Skeleton is a tiny implementation of the system that performs a small end-to-end function. It need not use the final architecture, but it should link together the main architectural components. The architecture and the functionality can then evolve in parallel." -- [Alistair Cockburn][ac]
* "The infrastructure of build, deploy, test can be time consuming to implement. You WILL need it, so do it first. If you don't do it now, when will you have time? Without a skeleton it is hard to drive development outside-in." -- [Seb Rose][sebrose]
