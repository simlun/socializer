Project Structure
=================

Inspired by Robert Martins [Clean Architecture][clean]:

* Independent of Frameworks
* Testable
* Independent of UI
* Independent of Database
* Independent of any external agency

* Keep the branding away from the backend code. A website and a name can change for marketing reasons, do not force the code to change for those reasons.
